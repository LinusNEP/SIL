SIL is a  framework that transforms human-robot interaction from the traditional master-apprentice model to a true symbiotic partnership. Unlike conventional approaches where robots passively execute commands, SIL enables continuous mutual adaptation between humans and agents through bidirectional learning in a shared latent task space.
