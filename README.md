# Symbiotic Interactive Learning (SIL)

> Beyond Master and Apprentice: Grounding Foundation Models for Symbiotic Interactive Learning in a Shared Latent Space

SIL is a framework for co-adaptive human–robot interaction (HRI). Unlike traditional approaches, where robots passively execute commands, SIL enables continuous mutual adaptation between humans and agents through bidirectional learning in a shared latent task space.
